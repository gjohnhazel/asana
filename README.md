## About

This CLI is a powerful and intuitive command-line tool designed to streamline your interaction with the Asana API. 
You can manage your tasks, projects, and workspaces directly from the terminal, boosting your productivity and reducing 
your reliance on the Asana web interface.

# Features

- **Authentication**: Log in and log out of your Asana account using Personal Access Tokens.
- **Task Management**: View tasks within your Asana workspaces.
- **Workspace Configuration**: Save and load default workspace settings.

# Usage

Since the Asana CLI is in the early state, you can get the binary from the release page.

# Contributing

I am always happy to get new feature requests and improvement suggestions.
